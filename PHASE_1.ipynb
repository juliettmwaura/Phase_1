    "# The Steps of OAuth\n",
    "Prior to using OAuth, we must also register our application with the authorizer and get our credentials to use during the process. We need to set up some information about the application, like the app's name or website, and most importantly, a redirect URI. The authorizer later uses this to contact the requesting app and tell them that the user said yes.\n",

    "A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string that refers to a resource. The most common are URLs, which identify the resource by giving its location on the Web.\n",

    "After registration, The first step is the authorization. Here, we send our users to the authorization server to ask for some permissions with our scope (permissions) that we would like to have. The user can see everything being requested on his behalf and confirm that they would like to grant our application access for those permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is the redirect. Redirect URIs are a critical part of the OAuth flow. After a user successfully authorizes their application, the authorization server then redirects the user back to the app with an authorization code in the URL. Because the redirect URL will contain sensitive information, it is critical that the service doesn’t redirect the user to arbitrary locations. The authorization code is used by our application in the final act of getting the access token.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is acquisition. This is where we finally receive our access token from the service provider so we can process API requests for our user. We use the authorization code we received in the redirect to our redirect url and our own application secret (which is acquired during initial registration) in order to get our user’s access token. The access token can then be used to make API calls on behalf of our user. It allows applications to have limited scopes to user data If you've ever used your Facebook or Google account to log in to a 3rd party website or app, then you've used OAuth--OAuth is what makes this sort of Single-Sign-On or SSO ability possible.\n",

    "# HTML Introduction\n",
    "HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language that describes the structure and semantic meaning of web pages. Web browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome interpret the HTML code and use it to render output. Unlike Python, JavaScript and other programming languages, markup languages like HTML don't have any logic behind them. Instead, they simply surround the content to convey structure and meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every web page you've ever visited is structured using HTML code. Being able to read and understand an HTML document is an incredibly useful tool in a data scientist's toolbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML makes use of tags which are interpreted by web browsers to affect how content is displayed. The p tag to define a paragraph is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also alter any number of attributes inside of the opening tags. For example, the a element, which is used for links, has an href attribute to specify the destination address of the link. If you wanted to link to www.flatironschool.comLinks to an external site., you could do so as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flatiron School\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also nest elements inside of each other. To have a link displayed as a separate paragraph, we could nest an a element inside of a p.\n",
    "\n",
    "This link will be a part of a separate paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic HTML Document Structure\n",
    "To use HTML5, the current up-to-date version, you can simply declare .\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you add an opening and closing html tag. This tells the web browser to interpret everything inside the tags as HTML code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every HTML page is made up of two primary sections: a head and a body. The head element contains metadata about the HTML document and other information for the browser, while the body element contains the actual content.\n",

    "# Cascading Style Sheets or CSS!\n",
    "HTML lets you mark-up your content with semantic structure. It forms the skeleton of your web page. HTML authors believe that creating marked-up documents and styling marked-up documents are entirely separate tasks. They see a difference between writing content (the data within the HTML document) and specifying presentation, the rules for displaying the rendered elements.CSS tells you how to write rules that define how browsers will present HTML. CSS is the language for styling web pages. The focus is on the aesthetic quality of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each presentation rule, there are 3 things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the specific HTML we want to style? What are the qualities we want to modify (e.g. the properties of text in a paragraph)? How do we want to modify the qualities of the element (e.g. font family, font color, font size, line height, letter spacing, etc.)? Once you've decided what to modify and how we can start writing CSS rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS selectors are a way of declaring which HTML elements you wish to style. Selectors can appear a few different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of HTML element(h1, p, div, etc.) The value of an element's id or class (\n",
    "\n",
    ",\n",
    "). The value of an element's attributes (value=\"hello\") The element's relationship with surrounding elements (a p within an element with class of .infobox) For example, if you want the body of the page to have a black background, your selector syntax may be html or body. For anchors, your selector would be a. A few more examples are listed below:\n",
    "/* The CSS comment syntax is text between \"slash-star\" and \"star-slash\" */\n",
    "\n",
    "/* selects all anchor tag elements in the document (e.g. Page Link) */ a\n",

    "\n",
    ") */ p Type selectors documentationLinks to an external site.\n",
    "The element type class is a commonly used selector. Class selectors are used to select all elements that share a given class name. The class selector syntax is: .classname. Prefix the class name with a '.'(period).\n",

    ") */ .helpful-hint You can also use the id selector to style elements. However, there should be only one element with a given id in an HTML document. This can make styling with the ID selector ideal for one-off styles. The id selector syntax is: #idvalue. Prefix the id attribute of an element with a # (which is called \"octothorpe,\" \"pound sign\", or \"hashtag\").\n",
    "\n",
    "/* selects the HTML element with the id 'main-header' (e.g.\n",

    "Each element has a list of qualities that can be styled. CSS \"property\" names identify those qualities. For text styling, examples of property names include text color, text-align and line-height.\n",

    "CSS Property Values are directly related to property names. If you are working with the color property, the value could be a named color such as red, or #660000. Some properties have their values set with words, others with numbers, and some can take both.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSS property name with a CSS property value is a CSS declaration. To apply a CSS declaration like color: blue to a specific HTML element, you need to combine your CSS declaration with a CSS selector. The association between one or more CSS declarations and a CSS selector is called a CSS declaration block. CSS declarations (one or more) that applied to a specific selector are wrapped by curly braces ({ }). Each declaration inside a declaration block must be separated by a semi-colon (;).\n",
